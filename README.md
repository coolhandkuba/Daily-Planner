Created a daily planner which will show the following: 
- The grayed out time slots mean that this time has already passed for the day
- The red time slot is the current hour that we are one
- The green time slots are future slots for the day

The daily planner is done by work hours (8AM - 6PM). 
You can save an event in each hour and it will be saved until you click "clear" for that given time. 

This planner utilizes moment.js for time formatting
